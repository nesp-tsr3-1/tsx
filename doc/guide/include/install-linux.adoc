==== Install Prerequisite software

The following instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Linux 18.04. If you are using a different Linux distribution you will need to adapt these commands for your system. If you are using macOS, we recommend using homebrew (https://brew.sh) to install dependencies.

Run the following commands to install prerequisite software:

----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nginx mysql-server python python-pip virtualenv git
----

==== Download TSX Workflow and Sample Data

Run the following command to download the TSX workflow into a folder named `tsx`

----
git clone https://github.com/nesp-tsr3-1/tsx.git
----

Then enter the `tsx` directory and run the following commands:

----
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
env/bin/activate
pip install â€“r requirements.txt
----

To download TSX workflow sample data that is referred to throughout this guide, run the following command:

----
python setup/download_sample_data.py
----

This will place the sample data into a directory called `sample-data`.

==== Database Setup

Initialise the database by running:
----
sudo setup/setup-database.sh
sudo mysql tsx < sample-data/seed.sql
----

Understanding the database schema is not essential to following the steps in this guide, but is recommended if you want to gain an in-depth understanding of the processing.

==== Update Workflow Configuration File

Copy the sample configuration file from `TSX_HOME\tsx.conf.example` to `TSX_HOME\tsx.conf`.
----
cp tsx.conf.example tsx.conf
----
