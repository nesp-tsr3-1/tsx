|===


=== Data sources file format

Format: CSV

Sample file: `data_sources.csv`

|===
|Column	|Notes
|SourceID	|Numeric, must match id in source database table
|TaxonID	|Alphanumeric, must match id in taxon database table
|DataAgreement	a|Numeric

- 0 = No
- 1 = Yes, preliminary agreement
- 2 = Yes, final agreement executed

|ObjectiveOfMonitoring	a|Numeric

- 1 = Monitoring for community engagement
- 2 = Baseline monitoring
- 3 = Monitoring for general conservation management – ‘surveillance’ monitoring
- 4 = Monitoring for targeted conservation management

|NoAbsencesRecorded	a|Numeric

- 0 = absences of species were recorded (non-detections)
- 1 = absences of species were observed in the field but not recorded

|StandardisationOfMethodEffort	a|Numeric

- 1 = Unstandardised methods/effort, surveys not site-based.
- 2 = Data collection using standardised methods and effort
but surveys not site-based (i.e. surveys spatially ad-hoc). Post-hoc site grouping not possible.
- 3 = Data collection using standardised methods and effort but surveys not site-based (i.e. surveys spatially ad-hoc). Post-hoc site grouping possible - e.g. a lot of fixed area/time searches conducted within a region but not at predefined sites.
- 4 = Pre-defined sites/plots surveyed repeatedly through time with varying methods and effort
- 5 = Pre-defined sites/plots surveyed repeatedly through time with methods and effort standardised within site units, but not across program - i.e. different sites surveyed have different survey effort/methods
- 6 = Pre-defined sites plots surveyed repeatedly through time using a single standardised method and effort across the whole monitoring program

|ConsistencyOfMonitoring	|Numeric
- 1 = Highly imbalanced because different sites are surveyed in different sampling periods and sites are not surveyed consistently through time (highly biased).
- 2 = Imbalanced because new sites are surveyed with time but monitoring of older sites is not maintained. Imbalanced survey design may result in spurious trends
- 3 = Imbalanced because new sites are added to existing ones monitored consistency through time
- 4 = Balanced; all (>90%) sites surveyed in each year sampled
|StartYear	|Numeric, optional, records before this year will be omitted from filtered output
|EndYear	|Numeric, optional, records after this year will be omitted from filtered output
|Exclude	|Boolean (0 = no, 1 = yes), all records will be omitted from filtered output
|SuppressAggregatedData	|Boolean (0 = no, 1 = yes), does not affect processing but is simply copied to the final output to indicate that aggregated data from this data source should not be published.
